The goal of `biocthis` is to ...

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `biocthis` using from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("biocthis")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("lcolladotor/biocthis")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = requireNamespace('biocthis')}
library("biocthis")
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('biocthis')` in R. Please
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __biocthis__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('biocthis')}
print(citation('biocthis'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `biocthis` was only made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
